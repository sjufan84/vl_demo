{"album": "Crash", "artist": "Dave Matthews Band", "description": "The mysterious, oft-romantic and a little creepy \u201cCrash Into Me\u201d is the third single off of the album Crash and one of the Dave Matthews Band\u2019s most popular songs of all time. In the years since its release, it has become noteworthy for its continuing popularity, despite being as many describe it, \u201cschlocky and largely irredeemable.\u201d\n\nWhile often remembered as \u201ca sexy ballad, full of both sorrow and dread, all about pining over someone from afar\u201d, and a popular choice for slow dance music at proms and such, the song actually has a creepier meaning upon close inspection.
