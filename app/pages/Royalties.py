        fadeIn ease 3s; -ms-animation: fadeIn ease 3s;">The distribution of royalties in the music industry
        is an incredibly complex system that ensures that everyone involved in the creative process is fairly
        compensated and credited for their contributions to a song.  This could be a single artist, a group of
        artists, a producer, a cowriter, a publisher, and many more.

        fadeIn ease 8s; -ms-animation: fadeIn ease 8s;">As the industry confronts the new world of generative
        content produced by models trained on an artist's or publisher's catalog, the challenge of maintaining
        the current system of equitable distribution becomes even more complex.
        Companies like Google, OpenAI,
        Apple, and others have begun to approach publishers offering
        to pay for the rights to use their catalogs
        in their training data.  But how in the world would
        this sum be distributed, would it be in the best
        intrest of the parties involved, and how would that even be determined?
        </h3>

        fadeIn ease 8s; -ms-animation: fadeIn ease 8s;">Additionally, these large tech companies
        have demonstrated that they are not always, if ever, acting in good faith to ensure fairness
        in the training of their models.  They are all famously secretive about where their training data
        comes from, how it is used, and even whether or not they had permission to use it in the first place.
        OpenAI recently admitted it is
        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai">
        <i>impossible to train their models without copyrighted data</i></a>, an astonishing admission
        given the stakes.  All of the companies that produce these frontier models
        offer some sort of 'copyright protection'
        for the developers using their platforms, essentially saying
        they will cover the legal fees of any developer sued
        for infringement.</h3>

        fadeIn ease 8s; -ms-animation: fadeIn ease 8s;">Without a clear
        alternative to outright selling or licensing
        their data to these larger companies, publishers may feel trapped,
        essentially surrendering revenue by not consenting, but sacrificing control, protection and the very
        future of royalty distribution with any generative
        content.</h3>

        get 'smarter' the more data, and the more quality data, they are trained on.  This is why
        the largest tech companies are so eager to acquire as much of it as possible.  But as mentioned
        previously, these models are black boxes... no one outside of these companies knows exactly
        what data is being used and how it is being used, leaving publishers in the dark about
        the true value of their data and unable to negotiate a fair price for it.</h3>

        that currently governs equity in the industry could be applied to generative models, then
        suddenly it becomes clear that their could be a transparent, and fair path forward.
        If all parties involved know exactly what data was used to train <i>their</i> models, why
