            complex speech signals into simpler, frequency-based representations. This method allows us
            to more effectively capture and analyze the key components of speech. By viewing these charts,
            we can visually interpret the 'frequency fingerprints' of different sounds, offering a unique
            insight into how our voice recognition technology decodes human speech.""")
