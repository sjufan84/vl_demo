        what else can we do with it?  Are we simply relegated to a world of playing
        defense against AI deepfakes?  Absolutely not!  While scary and disorienting,
        the advent of this technology actually opens up new and exciting ways that the artist,
        if they so choose, can create exciting new interactive experiences and opporunities for
        revenue generation.

        a revolutionary new path for artist engagement.  By leveraging multi-modal AI models
        that are trained <i>with the artist's input</i>, we aim to emulate a real-life co-writing session.
        <br>
        <br>
        We want to work <i>with</i> artists to select which data is used when creating their unique models. We are taking the opposite approach
        to companies whose models are a black box.  In fact, UMG is currently 
        <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/universal-music-sues-ai-company-using-songs-train-models/">suing Anthropic</a>,\
        an AI company with products similar to ChatGPT, for using copyrighted data in their training runs.  We choose to collaborate,
        rather than extract, to ensure that the artist is comfortable with the process <i>and</i> that those involved
        in the creation of the works used are compensated fairly.  If a song is used for training, we want to make sure
        royalties are distributed in a fair and ethical way.</h3>
