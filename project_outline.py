""" Outline of the project 
-- 1.  Take in a sample of someone's voice
-- 2.  Convert the voice into high level embeddings or at least
demo the possibility of doing so
-- 3.  Create a contract that takes in the embeddings and stores them
them as an NFT with metadata that represents a potential contract 
between the artist and the buyer.  The contract will be stored on the
blockchain and the metadata will be stored on IPFS.  
-- 4. Mock up a method for users to be able to use the artist's voice
to create a unique song and then be able to pay the artist for the
song by purchasing an NFT that represents the contract between the
artist and the buyer.  This would involve using an LLM to generate a
song based on the artist's voice.  The song would be stored on IPFS as
well as the metadata for the NFT.  The NFT would be stored on the
blockchain.  The user could also pay for standard songs personalized 
with the artist's voice.

Breakdown of each step:
    1.  Take in a sample of someone's voice:
        - Use a python library to take in a sample of someone's voice
    2.  Use a python library to convert the voice into a spectrogram
        - Use a python library to convert the spectrogram into a
        high level embedding as well as other distinguishing features
        = Convert the voice into high level embeddings or at least
        demo the possibility of doing so
    3.  Create a contract that takes in the embeddings and stores them
    them as an NFT with metadata that represents a potential contract
    between the artist and the buyer.  The contract will be stored on
    the blockchain and the metadata will be stored on IPFS. -- This involves
    creating a smart contract that only allows the artist to mint the NFT.
    4. See above for the rest of the steps """
