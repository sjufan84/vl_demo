0,167 BPM,Db Major,5 Leaf Clover,"[Verse 1]
Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Verse 2]
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

[Chorus]
Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

1,152 BPM,Eb Major,Ain’t Far From It,"[Verse 1]
Give me a stone cold George Jones, whiskey, bent barstool night
I wanna fly like a honky tonk moth to that neon light
This highway burnin' me up, blues been weighin' me down
There's a hole in the wall needs, fillin' on the edge of town
I'm gonna floorboard that Ford straight toward my baby's house
She'll be shinin' like a million dollar diamond second she steps out
She'll be slippin' me sugar, and buddy, she ain't gonna stop
'Til we Bonnie and Clyde slide into that parking lot

[Chorus]
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin'
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'
All that leads to late night lovin'
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it

[Verse 2]
That Tele rippin' Mississippi, cover band's sure on point
She on the dance floor, good Lord, droppin' every jaw in the joint
When she flips that switch, I'm off like a rocket
Ain't no way to stop it

[Chorus]
When we light that fuse on a Friday night
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strumming
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'
All that leads to late night lovin'
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night

2,96 BPM,E Major,Beautiful Crazy,"Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine
Takes forever gettin' ready
So she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
And she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears hеr heart on her sleeve
Yеah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
And says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep","celebrates the quirks and unpredictable nature of a loved one. The song portrays a woman who is whimsical, spontaneous, and emotionally open.

Hadn't had a good time since you know when
Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
I was feelin' like myself for the first time in a long time
Until I bumped into some of your friends over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightnin'
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

4,114 BPM,A Major,Fast Car,"11 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFast Car Lyrics[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car

I still hit them dive bars, every once in a blue moon
I've got a wild card, that I keep inside my boot
I've been thinkin' lately maybe I should save it
'Cause them hangovers sure kick my ass these days
So I spend most my happy hours here at home
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
But these days I hang my hat on what I won't do
I've been findin' peace of mind slowin' my roll
You learn to toe that line with time as it goes
In the middlе of growin' up and gettin' old

[Verse 2]
It's when you start thinkin', how much time lеft you got
If it's more sand, in the bottom or the top
'Cause that hourglass we have don't last forever
I've been thinkin' 'bout it more and more these days
It's like the less you have, the faster that it goes
In the middle of growin' up and gettin' old

[Chorus]
But I can still raise hell all night with the boys when I want to
Lay that hammer down to see how fast she'll go
