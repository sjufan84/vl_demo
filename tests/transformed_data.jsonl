Whether I'm clocking in those long hours or hanging out with my bar stool best friends, they're always there. Punching that time clock, wearing their wings off, just trying to save me from myself. It's like they're puttin' themselves straight through hell to keep me on track. My folks always wonder how the hell I get by, but it's all thanks to those angels workin' overtime."}]}

Well, boys shine their trucks at the super wash station, girls paint on denim and makeup while pourin' Tito's in a Route 44 cup. There's a circle up at the Dairy Queen and later on, the wild gets louder. It's like a rural route movie scene, falling in love underneath an endless sky. That's how it goes down on any given Friday night in a map dot town."}]}

Well, it's born outta real life, real love. The best ones, you just can't make up. They mean more when you've been there before. It could be hard times or heartbreaks, and sometimes all it takes is hitching a good rhyme to a mistake. You pour those feelings out over three chords, and just like that, a song was born. Whether it's on a houseboat or a Carolina mountain, the magic happens when you pour your heart into it."}]}

The walls of the world are closing in, and the city's spreading us thin. There used to be nothing but fields and a ten pew, Pentecostal church. Now it's asphalt parking and street lights.

It's a signal of the times, but not always for the better. We're losing the pond, the barn, the farm, and the fields, replaced by fast food and four lanes. Progress has its place, but I wish it would slow its pace and cut us all some slack. It's all changing way too fast, and what I wouldn't give to have the back forty back."}]}

It's the little things\u2014like starting the day with coffee and ending it with wine, or dancing without a care in the world. It's that crazy kind of beautiful, taking chances and wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her crazy is beautiful to me, and that's what really drives me wild."}]}

Oh, it's a beautiful thing. It's what makes the ride worthwhile. One minute, we're making plans for the weekend, and the next, we're just lounging on the couch. She's unpredictable but unforgettable, and that kind of crazy just amazes me. So, in a word, her unpredictability is what makes her so incredibly beautiful to me."}]}

Oh, it's a tricky thing. You might think leaving a one-horse town or breaking someone's heart will set you free. But sometimes, what you think you'll find ain't quite what real life has in store. You don't know what you got 'til it's gone, and all you want is what you can't get back. So, be careful what you wish for."}]}

I've found that what you want ain't always what you need. Those city lights might dazzle you, but they can't shine quite like the stars back home. Sometimes, the things you leave behind don't hold a candle to what you find. So yeah, be careful what you wish for."}]}

A hangover? Sure, it's a wrecking ball to the head, but you know what fixes it? Picking up another beer can and letting the good times roll. Sometimes, the best cure is more of what ails ya."}]}

Well, it's river kids and David stones, Detroit cars and local bars. It's cold keg beer, fixin' up trucks, and old bird dogs. It's the woman you love and that Maxwell House in your cup. Simple, but rich in all the ways that matter."}]}

It's the worn-out boots and old Levi's, the wind behind the stars and stripes. It's the little things, like that steaming cup of Maxwell House or saying my prayers and sending 'em to the sky.

Man, it ain't just about honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans. It ain't the banjo or the fiddle. Nah, it's the words and what they mean. If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk.

Country's lost its edge, man."}]}

I'll tell you what's missing: Outlaws. We don't need more of the same. We need someone to shake things up, to remind us of our roots. We need a preacher, a savior, heck, we need an outlaw. It's high time we raise the bar. Can I get an amen?"}]}

You'll find me in a junked-out joint off a backroad, where 'Whiskey River' is playing on the jukebox. It's got a honky-tonk sawdust dance floor and a neon, five o'clock, pro clock. There ain't no better place to nurse a heart that's as cold as ice."}]}
