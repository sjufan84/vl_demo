{"tempo":"96 BPM","key":"E Major","Song Title":"Beautiful Crazy","Lyrics":"Her day starts with a coffee\nAnd ends with a wine\nTakes forever gettin' ready\nSo she's never on time for anything\nWhen she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes\nWell, it kinda scares me\nThe way that she drives me wild\nAnd she drives me wild\nBeautiful, crazy\nShe can't help but amaze me\nThe way that she dances\nAin't afraid to take chances\nAnd wears h\u0435r heart on her sleeve\nY\u0435ah, she's crazy\nBut her crazy's beautiful to me\nShe makes plans for the weekend\nCan't wait to go out\nTill she changes her mind\nAnd says, \"Let's stay on the couch and watch TV\"\nAnd she falls asleep","description":"celebrates the quirks and unpredictable nature of a loved one. The song portrays a woman who is whimsical, spontaneous, and emotionally open. Despite her eccentricities, or perhaps because of them, she is deeply cherished. The narrative captures how her \"crazy\" is what makes her beautiful in the eyes of the person who loves her.","file_name":"..\/tests\/audio_files\/artist_main\/lc_beautiful_crazy.wav"}
