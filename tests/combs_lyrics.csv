5 Leaf Clover,"[Verse 1]
Well, I go to work every Monday
Get to do something I love
And I make it home every evening
To an angel God sent from above
Got an eight point on camera from last year
That this season looks like a ten
I got a barn with a fridge full of cold beer
On the weekend it's full of good friends

[Chorus]
I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

[Verse 2]
I got a half ton that's parked in the driveway
My dog wags his tail when he hears
I grew up in a good place to be from
My folks still got a bunch of good years

[Chorus]
Now I know I'm a lucky man, but I ain't sure why I am
'Cause it ain't like anyone deserves the world in the palm of their hand
Now I hit my knees, thankful as can be
But the one thing I can't get over
How'd a guy like me, who'd have been fine with three
Wind up with a five-leaf clover?

Ain’t Far From It,"[Verse 1]
Give me a stone cold George Jones, whiskey, bent barstool night
I wanna fly like a honky tonk moth to that neon light
This highway burnin' me up, blues been weighin' me down
There's a hole in the wall needs, fillin' on the edge of town
I'm gonna floorboard that Ford straight toward my baby's house
She'll be shinin' like a million dollar diamond second she steps out
She'll be slippin' me sugar, and buddy, she ain't gonna stop
'Til we Bonnie and Clyde slide into that parking lot

[Chorus]
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strummin'
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'
All that leads to late night lovin'
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it

[Verse 2]
That Tele rippin' Mississippi, cover band's sure on point
She on the dance floor, good Lord, droppin' every jaw in the joint
When she flips that switch, I'm off like a rocket
Ain't no way to stop it

[Chorus]
When we light that fuse on a Friday night
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight
Where twenty bucks buys guitars strumming
Paychecks turn to cold beer buzzin'
All that leads to late night lovin'
We ain't there yet, but we ain't far from it
'Bout to light that fuse on a Friday night
Get to cuttin' loose on this wound up tight

All Over Again,"[Verse 1]
Feels so familiar
You walking in here
Wearing just what you know makes me weak
And I'm already ordering you a drink
Baby, and then we're
Gonna get out of here
Just like the last time and the time before
We're at your house and through the door

[Chorus]
And we're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn ""I love you""
Into ""Boy, where you been?""
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

[Verse 2]
I'll think you're out of my system
At least 'til I miss ya
I'll start going through withdrawals
That's about the time you'll call

A Long Way,"[Verse 1]
Six beers and five guys and if I remember right, it was a
Wednesday when we got our buzz on for second hand six pack
Half smoked soft pack, light it up boys, take a drag
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought I was so damn cool

[Pre-Chorus]
But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah man, it really rocked my world

[Chorus]
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little longer
I can't tell you why they did, but things seemed to never end back then
Oh way back when, when a little went a long way

[Verse 2]
One girl, 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steakhouse makeout and the movies way up in the back
Credits roll on pace,to make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothin' new and she didn't have a clue

But my head was spinnin' like a Tilt-A-Whirl

Angels Workin’ Overtime,"[Verse 1]
I'm a 50 hour paycheck
Ain't slept a damn wink
Moth to a neon light
I'm a 9 to 5, 10 to 2
Shower in between the two
Let it ride kinda guy
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime

Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy

Any Given Friday Night,"[Verse 1]
Boys shine their trucks at the super wash station
Spin them Tire Wet wheels on the pavement
Done with that paycheck makin'
Twelve-inch kickers get to shakin'
Them girls get to paintin' on denim and makeup
Pourin' Tito's in a Route 44 cup
In between city limit signs
On any given Friday night

[Chorus]
Boys chase girls goin' thirty miles an hour
Circle up at the Dairy Queen

Like a rural route movie scene
In the nowhere dust, fallin' in love underneath an endless sky
Pick a map dot town, that's how it goes down
On any given Friday night

Ricky's at the red light, rockin' that Randall
Suzie's sittin' shotgun, drinkin' out the handle

A Song Was Born,"[Verse 1]
Haggard on a houseboat, tryin' not to sink
Wonderin' if he oughta float back or just stay here and drink
He found a guitar 'fore he found that Shasta shore
And a song was born

[Verse 2]
Willie on an airplane, brown bag and a pen
Flyin' high thinking 'bout being on the road again
Tried her out on a crowd down at John T. Floore's
A song was born

[Chorus]
Outta real life, outta real love
The best ones you can't make up
It just means more when you've been there before
Outta hard times, outta heartbreaks
Hitch a good rhyme to a mistake
Then you pour those feelings out over three chords
A song was born

[Verse 3]
I've wrote 'em in the Carolina mountains, on a Cabo beach
In a thousand rooms in Nashville, Tennessee

Back 40 Back,"[Verse 1]
""For sale by owner"" sign on Highway 59
A signal of the times, a turning of the page
There used to be nothing here but that nothing disappeared
The pond, the barn, the farm, the fields have long since been replaced
Asphalt parking where that ten pew, Pentecostal stood
Fast food, four lanes and a subdivided neighborhood

[Chorus]
The walls of the world are closin' in
The spreadin' city spreads us thin
We can't seem to make our ends meet the black
Nеver would've thought it wouldn't last
A way of life that timе moved past
What I wouldn't give to have the back forty back

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a sucker for knowing who lives next door
A view from my back porch, a pinch of peace and quiet
I can't get back the used to bes, so I hang on to the memories
Of when I could still look up and see the stars not street lights shining

[Chorus]
The walls of the world are closin' in
The spreadin' city spreads us thin
We can't seem to make our ends meet in the black
Never would've thought it wouldn't last

Beautiful Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild

Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve

Till she changes her mind

Be Careful What You Wish For,"[Verse 1]
Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town
Didn't see no use in sticking around
I was green and busting at the seams to leave
I was sitting on G, waiting on O
The day I hit eighteen, I hit the road
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street

[Pre-Chorus]
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need

[Chorus]
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone
And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for

[Verse 2]
She was holding on just a little too tight
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free

Beer Can,"[Verse 1]
I’ve been working this job 9 – 5
Minimum wage and overtime
But here comes a few days of unpaid vacation
And there ain’t no way José I'll waste them
'Cause there ain’t no better feeling than when

I pick up a beer can and get to feeling like superman
Its Friday night y'all, here's the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple and
Keep 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can’t stand
No nothing picks me up like a beer can

[Verse 2]
I woke up at I pm
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend
And there’s a wrecking ball sized hole in the wall in the basement
I ain't got no clue how or who could have made it
Well all I know is shit hit the fan
And here we go again

Beer Never Broke My Heart,"[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy

Better Back When,"[Verse 1]
We snuck in the back of that college town frat
'Cause they wouldn't let us in the front
Threw their Miller Time keg in a Chevrolet bed
And we let them horses run
Cut a path through the grass, yelling, ""Kiss my ass!""
With a middle finger in the wind
We laughed, we drank, every now and then I think
Man, I'd love to do that again

[Chorus]
Those were some good times
Those were the best nights
Thе freedom you feel when you're learning to fly
And thе song on the radio was singin' our lives
I can't say that the moon in the sky
Was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight
But it looked on fire back then
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when

[Verse 2]
Gravel lot spot by the porta J'ohns
'Bout a quarter mile from the door
Worked three weeks for a pair of cheap seats
To hear ""Never Wanted Nothing More""
We were feelin' that buzz from a summertime love
And a bottle tucked in a boot
It's crazy to think that looking back now
But back then, we never knew

Better Together,"[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Yeah, there's guys like us

And I know you're gonna call me out of your league
Tell all your friends that was a one-time thing
Smoke a few smokes, drink a few drinks
And really tell 'em what you think

[Chorus]
You're gonna call me crazy
A low-down, no account fool
And you're gonna say you hate me
Girl, do what you gotta do
But when you're 2AM buzzin', late night needin' loving
And it's lookin' like you're leavin' lonely
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you wish I'd change and I wish I could
It's bad when it's bad, when it's good, it's good
You love me and hate me and somewhere in between
I know my phone's gonna ring

[Chorus]
You're gonna call me crazy
A low-down, no account fool
And you're gonna say you hate me
Girl, do what you gotta do
But when you're 2AM buzzin', late night needin' loving
And it's lookin' like you're leavin' lonely
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me

Call me stubborn and hard-headed
Call me rough around the edges
I don't care what you call me
Just call me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're gonna call me crazy
A low-down, no account fool
And you're gonna say you hate me
Girl, do what you gotta do
But when you're 2AM buzzin', late night needin' loving
And it's lookin' like you're leavin' lonely
Baby, we both know you're gonna call me

Can I Get an Outlaw?,"[Verse 1]
Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six-string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still ought to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned, not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
These days it's all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Verse 2]
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and Wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother, that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?

I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
""Hoss you sure Hank done it this way?""

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singin' pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?

[Bridge]
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doin' country all wrong
Need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewin' tobacco, and whippin' ass
I need preacher, I need a savior, how 'bout y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
[Outro]
I pray country answers my call
Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?1Embed"
Cold As You,"[Verse 1]
It's a junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chock full o' toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home

[Pre-Chorus]
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to

[Chorus]
They got ""Whiskey River"" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you

[Verse 2]
Bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture o' you on the dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me

[Chorus]
""Whiskey River"" on the jukebox
A honky-tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
